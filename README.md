# COVID Autoregressive model
Analyzing dataset is a **[COVID-19 historical data](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide)** from 15.06.2020. 
Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is a generalization of an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. Both of these models are fitted to time series data either to better understand the data or to predict future points in the series (forecasting).

Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors model is one of the ARIMA models and was used in this case to forecast future number of infected with the sars-cov-2.
